        "description": "<p>One of the most versatile and inventive English artists of the postwar era, David Hockney settled in Los Angeles in 1964. An especially iconic example from a group of double portraits of friends and associates from the 196os, this painting depicts the contemporary-art collectors Fred and Marcia Weisman in the sculpture garden of their Los Angeles home. As stiff and still as the objects surrounding them, the couple stands apart, his stance echoed in the totem pole to the right, hers in the Henry Moore sculpture behind her. Brilliant light flattens the scene and sets the couple in sharp relief; they seem oblivious to each other as well as to their art.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>Pop Art icon Andy Warhol’s embrace of mass culture radically altered the course of late twentieth-century art history, redefining both what a work of art can or should depict as well as the way in which it can be made. His breakthrough artistic moment came when he took the commercial printing process of photo-emulsion silkscreen and applied it to canvas. This allowed him to reproduce the same image over and over, quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Warhol celebrated both products and personalities, giving equal weight to soup cans and movie stars. He began using images of Elizabeth Taylor in early 1962. Her beauty and allure fueled interest in the sordid tragedies of her personal life, which included failed marriages, love affairs, and a near-death experience that occurred while filming <em>Cleopatra</em> (1963). <em>Liz #3 [Early Colored Liz]</em> comes from a series of thirteen canvases, each with the same image of Taylor set before a jewel-toned background. Warhol used a preexisting publicity still of Taylor as his source material, which he cropped and then enlarged so that the actress literally fills the screen. Her signature features — her eyes and lips — have been accentuated with colors that hover between vibrant and vulgar. This garish use of “makeup” is meant to suggest style and glamor, reinforcing Taylor’s celebrity status.</p>\n",

In <em>Volunteer</em>, he depicted a washing machine, an ice-cream cone, and a person in a business suit, referencing technological progress, indulgence, and conformity. The large blue handprint centered in the composition—an enlargement of the artist’s own handprint—represents the uncertain role of the individual in the rapidly changing world of the 1960s. On the preparatory sketch for this work, Rosenquist wrote: “The volunteer who is puzzled doesn’t know what to do but willing.”</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>After decades as a representational painter, in her seventies Alma Thomas turned to abstraction, creating shimmering, mosaic-like fields of color with rhythmic dabs of paint that were often inspired by forms from nature. The artist had been fascinated with space exploration since the late 1960s, and her later paintings often referenced America’s manned Apollo missions to the moon. Although she had never flown, Thomas began to paint as if she were in an airplane, capturing what she described as shifting patterns of light and streaks of color. “You look down on things,” she explained. “You streak through the clouds so fast. . . . You see only streaks of color.”</p>\n<p><em>Starry Night and the Astronauts</em> evokes the open expanse and celestial patterns of a night sky, but despite its narrative title, the work could also be read as an aerial view of a watery surface, playing with our sense of immersion within an otherwise flat picture plane. The viewer is immersed not only in the sense of organic expanse that this painting achieves, however, but also in an encounter with Thomas’s process: the surface here is clearly constructed stroke by stroke. Meanwhile, the glimpses of raw canvas between each primary-colored mark seem as vivid as the applied paint itself—almost as if the composition were backlit. Thomas relied on the enlivening properties of color throughout her late-blooming career. “Color is life,” she once proclaimed, “and light is the mother of color.” This painting was created in 1972, when the artist was eighty. In the same year, she became the first African American woman to receive a solo exhibition at a major art museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>Although influenced by Abstract Expressionist artists in New York in the early 1950s, Joan Mitchell did not prioritize self-expression: her often exuberant abstractions were “about landscape, not about me,” she once explained. Mitchell painted large, light-filled canvases animated by loosely applied skeins of bright color—here infused with the energy of a large metropolis.</p>\n<p>The title suggests a relationship between the painting’s network of pigments and the nerves or arteries of an urban space. The sense of spontaneity conveyed in City Landscape, however, belies Mitchell’s methods. Unlike many of her contemporaries, who were dubbed “action painters,” Mitchell worked slowly and deliberately. “I paint a little,” she said. “Then I sit and look at the painting, sometimes for hours. Eventually, the painting tells me what to do.”</p>\n",
